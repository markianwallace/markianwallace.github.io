{% marginfigure "BH" "assets/img/BHSunset.jpg" "Britannia House" %} If you'd like to come work with us, just [get in touch](mailto://mark.wallace@kcl.ac.uk). There are new projects available for postdocs, PhDs, and undergraduates.

Projects in the group encompass a broad range of traditional subject disciplines, from physics and computation, to molecular biology and engineering. No one starts of with all of these skills; from experience all you really need are some smarts, and an enthusiasm for learning from your mistakes. This interdisciplinary approach enables us to develop new physical techniques and apply them to unlock important problems in cell biology.

## Directions
We're located at Britannia House, close to the [Guy's Campus](https://goo.gl/maps/Gk2Xy9wkrnw) of KCL. The nearest underground station is Borough, or a five minute walk from [London Bridge](https://goo.gl/maps/VTGjrDXAjCS2) and [Elephant and Castle](https://goo.gl/maps/WAVXYiihGHT2).
