## Droplet Interface Bilayers

Using microfabrication and 3D-printing we develop new artificial lipid bilayers that give us control over membrane properties.

## An Artificial Plasma Membrane
We build mimics of cell membranes from their component parts. This helps us understand precisely how these components work together. It also lets us build artificial protocells with new emergent properties.
