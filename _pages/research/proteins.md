## Linking Conformation to Function in Individual Ion Channels
By combining single-molecule sensitive measurements of shape change and ionic flux in an ion channel we are able to shed new light onto the mechanism of these important proteins.

## Assembly of Membrane Protein Complexes
We are interested in precisely how large macromolecular protein complexes can assemble in a membrane. What drives this assembly, and how can we control it?
