Daisy joins us through the Institute of Chemical Biology CDT programme. She works between the Wallace Group and the Membrane Biophysics Group at Imperial College in collaboration with Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Her research interests lie in the development and study of droplet interface bilayers using block copolymers, and the subsequent incorporation of nanopores into these systems. Prior to joining the group, Daisy obtained a BSc (Hons) in Chemistry from Imperial College.

Daisy has a keen interest in and passion for public outreach and science communication, and recently began voluntary work as a STEM Ambassador alongside her studies.
