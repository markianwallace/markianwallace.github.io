Steven joined the Wallace group at King's in October 2018 after spending one year of PhD-work at the University of Antwerp in the combined fields of oncology and plasma science. During his time in the Wallace group, Steven will explore the possibilities of combining single-molecule FRET and optical single-channel recording for simultaneous event detection, and apply it to elucidate structure-function relationships of transmembrane channels and pores.
