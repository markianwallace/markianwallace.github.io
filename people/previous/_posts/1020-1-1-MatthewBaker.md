Matt was a PDRA in the lab. He brought a physics background which we supplemented with early super-resolved imaging in live bacteria. We also had fun supporting Matt’s strong passion for science communication, now sustained in an independent position as Scientia Research Fellow in the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences at the University of New South Wales. In 2018 Matt won the UNSW Dean’s Award for Excellence in Science Communication.
