Studies of the chemical vapour deposition of diamond films at growth rates >100 um h-1 with a 10-kW DC-arc jet system are described. Additions of small amounts of N2 to the standard CH4/H2/Ar feedstock gas results in strong CN(B->X). emission, and quenches C2(d->a). and HÙè∞Ñ-alpha emissions from the plasma. Species selective, spatially resolved optical emission measurements have enabled derivation of the longitudinal and lateral variation of emitting C2, CN radicals and H (n=3) atoms within the plasma jet. Scanning electron microscopy and laser Raman analyses indicate that N2 additions also degrade both the growth rate and quality of the deposited diamond film; the latter technique also provides some evidence for nitrogen inclusion within the films.
