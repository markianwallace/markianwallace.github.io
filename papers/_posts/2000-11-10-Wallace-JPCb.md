The motions of a dye-labeled DNA hairpin loop (Cy5-5′-GGGTT-(A)30-AACCC-3′-TMR) have been investigated through the fluctuations in proximity ratio from fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). We examine three solution conditions: (1) MilliQ water, (2) Tris-EDTA buffer, and (3) Tris-EDTA buffer plus an excess of DNA complementary to the loop sequence, (T)30. Correlations in proximity ratio show submillisecond dynamics. Static heterogeneity is revealed from the distribution of proximity ratio amplitudes. The observed stretched exponential kinetics are consistent with a model based on the transition between two states over a complex energy landscape.
