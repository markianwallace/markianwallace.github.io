A key conundrum in the construction of an artificial cell is to simultaneously maintain a robust physical barrier to the external environment, while also providing efficient exchange of information across this barrier. Biomimicry provides a number of avenues by which such requirements might be met. Herein, we provide a brief introduction to the challenges facing this field and explore progress to date.
