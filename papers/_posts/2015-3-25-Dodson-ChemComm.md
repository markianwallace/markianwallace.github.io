We show that the effects of applied magnetic fields on radical pair reactions can be sensitively measured from sample volumes as low as âˆ¼100 femtolitres using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. Development of a fluorescence-based microscope method is likely to be a key step in further miniaturisation that will allow detection of magnetic field effects on single molecules.
