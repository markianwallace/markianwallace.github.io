Optical platforms for assaying membrane protein function offer a promising route to scalable high-throughput screening (see picture). For the first time quantitative measurements of membrane protein inhibition are reported in an optically addressable lipid bilayer array. Wide-field total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging of Ca2+ flux enables the quantification of α-hemolysin inhibition by γ-cyclodextrin.
