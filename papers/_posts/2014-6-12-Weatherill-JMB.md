Combining simultaneous single-molecule fluorescence measurements of ion channel conformational change with single-channel electrophysiology would enable a direct link between structure and function. Such methods would help us to create a truly molecular “movie” of how these important biomolecules work. Here we review past and recent progress toward this goal.
