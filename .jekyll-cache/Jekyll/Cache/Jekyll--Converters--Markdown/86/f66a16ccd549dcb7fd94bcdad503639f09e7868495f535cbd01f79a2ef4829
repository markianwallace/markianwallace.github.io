In comparison to globular proteins, the spontaneous folding and insertion of Î²-barrel membrane proteins is surprisingly slow, typically occurring on the order of minutes. Using single-molecule FÃ¶rster Resonance Energy Transfer to report on the folding of fluorescently-labelled Outer Membrane Protein G we measured the real-time insertion of a Î²-barrel membrane protein from an unfolded state. Folding events were rare, and fast (&lt;20 ms); occurring immediately upon arrival at the membrane. This combination of infrequent, but rare, folding resolves this apparent dichotomy between slow ensemble kinetics, and the typical timescales of biomolecular folding.</p>
