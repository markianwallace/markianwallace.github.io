<p>Using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy of droplet interface bilayers containing the potassium-sensitive fluorophore APG-4, we imaged the ionic flux through individual electropores. We are able to monitor up to 30 individual pores in parallel and show voltage dependent responses in fluorescence that corresponds to the measured ionic current. These experiments help quantify the scope and current limitations of optical single channel recordings of potassium flux.</p>
