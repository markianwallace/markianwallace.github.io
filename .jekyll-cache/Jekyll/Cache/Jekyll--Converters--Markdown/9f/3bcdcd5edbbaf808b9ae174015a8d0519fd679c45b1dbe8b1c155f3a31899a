<p>Our efforts on droplet interface bilayers in Oxford began in the summer of 2005 following a suggestion made by David Needham at â€œLipids, liposomes and biomembranesâ€, a conference in Vancouver. He proposed that a bilayer would form between two droplets brought together in an oil (squalene) containing a lipid (glycerol monooleate) and that this might be a means to miniaturize planar bilayer recording.</p>
