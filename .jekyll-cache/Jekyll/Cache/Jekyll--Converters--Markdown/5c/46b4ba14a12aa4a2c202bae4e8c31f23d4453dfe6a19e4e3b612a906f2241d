<p>Structural and biochemical investigations have helped illuminate many of the important details of MACPF/CDC pore formation. However, conventional techniques are limited in their ability to tackle many of the remaining key questions, and new biophysical techniques might provide the means to improve our understanding. Here we attempt to identify the properties of MACPF/CDC proteins that warrant further study, and explore how new developments in fluorescence imaging are able to probe these properties.</p>
