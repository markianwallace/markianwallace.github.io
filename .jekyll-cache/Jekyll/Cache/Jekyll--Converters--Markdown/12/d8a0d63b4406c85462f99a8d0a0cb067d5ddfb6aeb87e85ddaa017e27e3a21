Single-channel recording from pore-forming toxins (PFTs) provides a clear and direct molecular readout of toxin action. However to complete any mechanistic understanding of PFT behavior, this functional kinetic readout must be linked to the underlying changes in toxin structure, binding, conformation, or stoichiometry. Here we review how single-molecule imaging methods might be used to further our understanding of PFTs, and provide detailed practical guidance on the use of droplet interface bilayers as a method capable of examining both single-molecule fluorescence and single-channel electrical signals from PFTs.</p>
