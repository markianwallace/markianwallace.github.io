I"Ä<p>Vivek presented his work on Origami Clathrin-Mimic Networks at the American Biophysical Society meeting The assembly of clathrin coats on vesicles is a major endocytotic pathway, and the effects of clathrinâ€™s structure on vesicle formation are still unclear. Here we exploit DNA origami nanostructures designed as structural mimics of clathrin. Using DNA clathrin mimics we seek to isolate the effects of shape and structure on membrane properties. DNA nanostructures associate with lipid membranes via cholesterol anchors and can be triggered to polymerise into a meshwork on the membrane. We explore how this origami network can be used to induce structural changes in giant unilamellar vesicles.</p>
